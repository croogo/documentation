# 1.4

Croogo v1.4.x is initially going to be a direct migration from v1.3.x. It will
also upgrade the CakePHP framework from 1.3 to 2.1.

It currently has its first beta release for early developer testing. Whilst in
beta release, the code is subject to regular and sometimes significant changes.

Because of this, it is not recommended to build production sites on 1.4, just
yet, as downloading an update to fix a bug may also download configuration
changes which could stop your site working.

We are beginning to migrate the 1.3 documentation to 1.4, but again as the
project is still in beta mode, some areas could be subject to change.

More information coming soon.
