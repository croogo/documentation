# Plugins

From [book.cakephp.org](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/plugins.html): CakePHP allows you to set up a combination of controllers, models, and views and release them as a packaged application plugin that others can use in their CakePHP applications.

Croogo 1.4 is now using the default CakePHP bootstrap mechanism. However, Croogo has
extra functionalities with routes and plugin activation callbacks.
