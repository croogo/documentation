# Multilingual

Croogo comes with a Translate plugin. Activating it from **Extensions &gt; Plugins** page will allow you to translate your content in other languages.

By default, it supports translations for Nodes, Blocks and Links. You can add more by editing /app/plugins/translate/config/translate_bootstrap.php file.

## Languages

Before you can start translating your content, you need to let Croogo know about other languages. You can manage them from **Settings &gt; Languages** page.

## Viewing translated content from front-end

Visit http://your-site.com/eng from your browser, where eng is the locale for English.
