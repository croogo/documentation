# Taxonomy

You are free to categorize your content in as many ways as you want.

## Vocabulary

Vocabularies are collections of terms. For example, you have a **list** of categories (including Personal, Travel, News, etc) and we can call that list a **vocabulary**. And you can name that vocabulary 'Categories'. Same can be done for tags â€“ a vocabulary named, 'Tags'.

By default, Croogo has two vocabularies: Categories and Tags.

## Term

From above example: Personal, Travel and News are all **terms**. And they can be associated to nodes.
