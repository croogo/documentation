# Roles

All users belong to a particular Role. Croogo distinguishes users in three different roles by default:

* **Admin**: The administrator or super user
* **Registered**: Registered and logged in user
* **Public**: Visitors who are not logged in to the site

You can add more roles to suit your needs.
