# Plugins

From [book.cakephp.org](http://book.cakephp.org/view/1111/Plugins): CakePHP allows you to set up a combination of controllers, models, and views and release them as a packaged application plugin that others can use in their CakePHP applications.

Croogo makes plugins more awesome by introducing their own bootstrap, routes and activation callbacks.
