# 1.5

Croogo v1.5.x has its first beta release for early developer testing. Whilst in
beta release, the code is subject to regular and sometimes significant changes.

Because of this, it is not recommended to build production sites on 1.5, just
yet, as downloading an update to fix a bug may also download configuration
changes which could stop your site working.

There really is no documentation as yet, we've just uploaded this to inform you 
that there is a [hosted demo available for those who want a sneak peak](http://wiki.croogo.org/1.5/getting-started/demo).

More information coming soon.
