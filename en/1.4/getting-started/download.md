There is a
[zipped download of Croogo 1.4](http://github.com/croogo/croogo/downloads)
available from [GitHub](http://github.com/croogo/croogo/downloads), but this is
from Nov 2011.

To get the latest version of you need to clone the
[1.4 branch from GitHub](http://github.com/croogo/croogo/tree/1.4).

If cloning the repository from GitHub you need to download CakePHP 2 separately
and copy the Croogo repository into the app folder of CakePHP.
